to do:
1. write a function to get average claw spec mathematically instead of through a sim to make processing faster
2. chart dps for each weapon, sorted by boss, in a line graph (xaxis - def; yaxis - dps; hover - dps, dpa)
3. add functionality for inq 2.5% set bonus
4. chart dwh spec accuracy for applicable targets based on gear input (xaxis - def@ 0hammer, def@ 1hammer, def@ 2hammer...; yaxis = accuracy; hover - acc, dpa, defReduction)
5. chart bgs spec damage for applicable targets based on gear input (xaxis - def, yaxis - damage; hover - accuracy, dpa)
6. Add maxhit for each weapon to all tooltips when hovering over a line

to do part 2:
1. build basic webpage that allows you to select inputs and save as loadouts
2. hide/show selected weapons on graph
3. compare loadouts , allow for side by side or overlap (overlap may cause clutter if all weapons are shown)
4. add range items
